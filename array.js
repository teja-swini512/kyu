// I'm new to coding and now I want to get the sum of two arrays... Actually the sum of all their elements. I'll appreciate for your help.
function arrayPlusArray(arr1, arr2) {
    const sum1 = arr1.reduce((acc, num) => acc + num, 0);
    const sum2 = arr2.reduce((acc, num) => acc + num, 0);
    return sum1 + sum2;
  }
